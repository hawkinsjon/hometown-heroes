## Project Context

This application was developed and donated by a member of the Berkeley Heights Veterans Affairs Committee to modernize the banner submission process. The software is made publicly available for transparency and to ensure the township has continued access to the codebase, but it remains proprietary software.

### Why Open but Proprietary?

While the code is visible on GitHub, it is **not open source**. This approach serves several purposes:

- **Transparency**: The township can review and audit the code
- **Accessibility**: The township always has access to the source code
- **Protection**: Prevents unauthorized use or redistribution
- **Quality**: Demonstrates professional software development practices
